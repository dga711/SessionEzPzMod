# SessionEzPzMod
A patcher to use custom maps and assets in Project Session without the hassle of unpacking.

I am happy to introduce this to you, as this will make modding much easier.  
This opens up the use of custom assets to a wider non technical audience, which is exciting.

## Installation
**Please follow the instructions.** It doesn't take a lot of time and other people don't want to explain it 100 times.  
*If your game is already unpacked you should clean it up or redownload. Otherwise bad stuff can happen.*

I made a video showing you the simple process [here](https://youtu.be/vQXdg9g0M8Y)

If you already unpacked the game previously you should clean up your Content folder. Delete everything besides the _Paks_ and _Movies_ folder.

1. Download [here](https://github.com/dga711/SessionEzPzMod/releases) and unpack EzPzMod somewhere.
2. Open EzPzMod
3. The path to the Session folder should already be set. Otherwise click "Select Folder" and browse to Session folder.  
It should be something like `...\steamapps\common\Session`
4. Then click "Patch"
5. DONE!

-> You should to have to do this *only once*, until it breaks because of updates or something else.

## Usage
1. Download a map
2. Unpack/Copy the files to the `...\steamapps\common\Session\SessionGame\Content` folder  
_(Some maps could differ)_  
3. In `...\steamapps\common\Session\SessionGame\Config` should be a new file called `UserEngine.ini`.  
Here you can set the map that you want to load.

I expect there will be awesome tools/launchers to aid you with downloading and setting maps, without doing it manually in the future!

## Important Notes
* ~~Texture Mods (Clothes, Decks etc.) need to recreate the full path when the game is not unpacked. So current mods will not work rightaway. But seems to work for people. There will be better solution in the future.~~ Using MapSwitcher helps with that.
* After leaving the appartment you will go back to NYC. This is something the map switchers will fix for you.

## Disclaimer
All rights on Project Session and its assets belong to crea-ture Studios.  
If you use this stuff in your tools/launchers etc. don't just steal and forget to credit the hard work ;-)

When modding breaks your game, don't blame the Session devs. This is all unofficial stuff and not their problem.
