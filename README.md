# SessionEzPzMod
A patcher to use custom maps and assets in Project Session without the hassle of unpacking.

I am happy to introduce this to you, as this will make all things modding much easier.  
This opens up the use of custom assets to a wider non technical audience, which is exciting.

## Installation
**Please follow the instructions.** It doesn't take a lot of time and other people don't want to explain it 100 times.  
*If your game is already unpacked you should clean it up or redownload. Otherwise bad stuff can happen.*

I made a video showing you the simple process [here](https://youtu.be/vQXdg9g0M8Y)

1. Download [here](https://github.com/dga711/SessionEzPzMod/releases) and unpack EzPzMod somewhere.
2. Open EzPzMod
3. "Click "Select Folder" and browse to Session folder.  
It usually should be something like `...\steamapps\common\Session`
4. Then click "Patch"
5. DONE!

-> You should to have to do this *only once*, until it breaks because of updates or something else.

## Usage
1. Download a map
2. Unpack/Copy the files to the `...\steamapps\common\Session\SessionGame\Content` folder  
_(Some maps could differ)_  
3. In `...\steamapps\common\Session\SessionGame\Config` should be a new file called `UserEngine.ini`.  
Here you can set the map that you want to load.

I expect there will be awesome tools/launchers to aid you with downloading and setting maps, without doing it manually in the future!

All rights on Project Session and its assets belong to crea-ture Studios.  
If you use this stuff in your tools/launchers etc. don't just steal and forget to credit the hard work ;-)

When modding breaks your game, don't blame the Session devs. This is all unofficial stuff and not their problem.
